# PseudoTransientDiffusion.jl

This repository contains various diffusion solvers to examplify, test and asses the performance of the pseudo-transient method, including the convergence acceleration via damping (second order Richardson method \[[Frankel, 1950](https://doi.org/10.2307/2002770)\]).

ðŸš§ work in progress - more to come soon.

## The diffusion equation
In this study we will use the (non-linear) diffusion (reaction) equation in 1D, 2D and 3D.

### The 1D diffusion
The linear equation has `D=1` while the nonlinear version considers the case `D=H^3`:
```julia
qHx   = -D*dH/dx
dH/dt = -dqHx/dx
```
### The 2D diffusion
The linear equation has `D=1` while the nonlinear version considers the case `D=H^3`:
```julia
qHx   = -D*dH/dx
qHy   = -D*dH/dy
dH/dt = -(dqHx/dx + dqHy/dy)
```
### The 3D diffusion
The linear equation has `D=1` while the nonlinear version considers the case `D=H^3`:
```julia
qHx   = -D*dH/dx
qHy   = -D*dH/dy
qHz   = -D*dH/dz
dH/dt = -(dqHx/dx + dqHy/dy + dqHz/dz)
```
